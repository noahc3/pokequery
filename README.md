# Running the PokeQuery source code

If for some reason the website at https://pokequery.noahc3.ml cannot be accessed, you can run the source code here.

* Install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/
* Open a terminal in this folder
* Run 'npm install' once
* Run 'npm start' to start a webserver to serve the website
* Node should automatically open your browser to the page, but if it doesn't it should be at http://localhost:3000 (check console to confirm).


You can find the SQLite database file in the public folder.
